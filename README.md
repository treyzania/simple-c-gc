# Simple C GC

This is some tests I'm making for learning about garbage collectors and
working with memory-management models.

## Dependencies

I've only tried building this on Debian, but if you use anything other than
that then you should be smart enough to figure out how to build it yourself.

So you should have the following packages installed:

* `pkg-config`

* `libglib2.0-dev` (And probably `glib-2.0`, if it doesn't come with it.)
